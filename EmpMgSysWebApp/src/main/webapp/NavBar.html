Creating an Employee Management System (EMS) using Java in Eclipse with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for the front end, and Oracle SQL database for the backend, integrated with Servlets, can result in a robust and scalable solution. Here's an overview of  project:
<br>
Project Setup:

Set up Eclipse IDE for Java development.
Create a dynamic web project in Eclipse.
Configure the project to use Servlets for server-side logic.
<br>

Frontend Development:

Use HTML for structuring the web pages.
Apply CSS for styling the user interface.
Utilize Bootstrap for responsive design and UI components to enhance user experience.
Design user-friendly interfaces for employee management functionalities such as adding, editing, and deleting employee records, viewing employee details, etc.
<br>

Backend Development:

Set up an Oracle SQL database to store employee information.
Design and create tables to store employee data, including fields like employee ID, name, department, position, etc.
Implement SQL queries and scripts to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.
Use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to establish a connection between the Java application and the Oracle database.
Write Java classes to handle database operations, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving employee records.
<br>

Integration with Servlets:

Create Servlets to handle HTTP requests and responses.
Implement Servlets to interact with the backend database and execute CRUD operations based on user actions.
Use Servlets to process form submissions, validate user input, and perform server-side processing.
Ensure proper error handling and exception management within the Servlets.
